;~~PlatformIO local user configuration
;  Copy this file to platformio_user.ini and edit for your local config
;
;~~ Serial Port Configuration
;  'monitor_port' and 'upload_port' need to be defined.
;   For ESPixelStick, these ports will be the same.
;
;   The [env] section is top level and will be used for all devices
;   and environments. If you have only one device, you can define
;   the port here, or do nothing at all and PlatformIO will attempt
;   to auto-detect it.
;
;   If you have multiple devices, you can define global [esp8266]
;   or [esp32] specific ports.  If you want to target a specific
;   build environment, you can do that as well. A list of all
;   [env:] targets is defined in platformio.ini.
;
;~~ Optional configuration
;   Configurations defined here will override platformio.ini
;   https://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html
