# Doofah

Doofah is a remote control emulator to be used in the Thunder ecosystem. It will consist of a Plugin communicating to an endpoint. The endpoint will contain the needed hardware to control the box. For now only we only focused on a BLE endpoint running on a cheap widely available ESP32 microcontroller. IR should also be posible in future.
